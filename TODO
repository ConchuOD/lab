- extra arg to connect to the boards uart after restarting
  - this has to be interactive, able to use the console
- handle new commands interactively, eg reboot from inside program?
- internal menu to switch between the different boards
  - issue commands etc without leaving the window
- must retain the basic interface though for use in my build system
