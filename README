yk*cmd wrapper for my board "farm"

I can either use it in scripts w/ args like on or off or run it as a wee TUI to
control the boards "manually". I am lazy, so it is done for now. Maybe when I
get my whole "farm" set back up properly I will change my mind on that one.

```
lab 1.0.0

USAGE:
    lab [OPTIONS]

OPTIONS:
    -b, --board <BOARD>          board to operate on [default: icicle]
    -c, --config <CONFIG>        input yaml config file [default: config.yaml]
    -f, --function <FUNCTION>    command (reboot, off, goodnight) [default: interactive]
    -h, --help                   Print help information
    -V, --version                Print version information
```
